Simulation comparison
=====================

The goal of this project is to write the same simulation in a few languages to get an understanding of the tradeoffs between development time, memory usage, CPU time, and so on.
The candidate languages so far are python, C, go, and Rust.

I'll try keeping this README up-to-date with the findings...
